#Goldbach Conjecture Kata

We'll be practicing recursion with the [Goldbach conjecture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goldbach%27s_conjecture):  

>"Every even integer greater than 2 can be expressed as the sum of two primes"

Some examples of input and corresponding output:

* goldbach_partition_of(4)  ->  [2,2]
* goldbach_partition_of(6)  ->  [3,3]
* goldbach_partition_of(8)  ->  [3,5]
* goldbach_partition_of(10) ->  [5,5]
